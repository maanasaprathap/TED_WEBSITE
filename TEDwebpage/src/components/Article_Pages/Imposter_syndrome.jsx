                                    To all the young girls out there ( sorry boys)Looking for ways to empower yourself ?? Has all the feminist talks left you with goosebumps and the urge to do something about it.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Here are a few misconceptions about Feminist activities that you might (not) want to follow ..<br />
                                    1.Indulge in discussions proving men to be wrong<br />
                                    2.Break the womanly stereotypes and force others to do so<br />
                                    3.Throw in words that sound powerful even if it's out of context<br />
                                    <br />Though this might be a bit exaggerated , this is how  modern feminists of  today are liberating themselves through active feminist movement.  YES, this is the same protest that years ago had earned  the basic " I'm a human too" status to women.But did this lose its momentum and became ANTI-MEN ??? This tarnished reputation is partially due to people who arenâ€™t well-versed on the topic but  have a lot of premeditated misperceptions on the characterization of feminists. With celebrities who get their hair chopped down and call it a " liberating and empowering move " to sharing plagiared quotes on feminism, the plight of today's feminism is indeed saddening.
